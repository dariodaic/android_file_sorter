### Why this gem?

It helps me when renaming files copied from a mobile device.
Currently, it works only for Android OS v4.3.

It is essentially a personal project but it might help other Android owners.

### Usage

Install the gem using *gem install android_file_sorter*.

Afterwards, enter a directory where you copied files from your mobile device
and run *android_file_sorter*. Directory where you placed your files must be empty,
or AFS will exit with a notification.

From there on, follow the instructions in the menu.
